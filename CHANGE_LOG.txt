Version 0.4.0

	* BREAKING CHANGE: Removed async code. This code never worked (it blocked).
          If you depend on this code and it seems to work for you, stick with 0.3.0,
          but beware that futures may block and not return right away, rather than
          behaving like proper async code should.

Version 0.3.0

	* ADDED optional async code

Version 0.2.0

	* stream_until_token() now returns whether or not the token was found.
        * stream_until_token() no longer counts the bytes of the token itself.

Version 0.1.0

	* Initial version.
